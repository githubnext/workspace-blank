## User Authentication and Authorization

The blog system uses Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. It supports OAuth2-based authentication with providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub. The authentication tokens are validated and stored in the client's local storage or cookies.

### Setting Up User Authentication and Authorization

1. Configure the OAuth2 providers in the `application.properties` file.
2. Implement the authentication and authorization logic in the `SecurityConfig` class.
3. Create the necessary API endpoints in the `AuthController` class.
4. Update the React frontend to handle user authentication and authorization.
